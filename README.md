# BonsaiTreesCompat
Custom datapack for Bonsai Trees 3 by davenonymous that adds support for the mods in my custom modpackand removes all the annoying stick drops.

Adds sapling support for the following mods:
*Better Azalia (tree generates Azalia logs instead of Oak)
*Oh, the Biomes You'll Go - Let me know if I missed any!
*Ars Elemental (Flashing Archwood)
*Also adds support for Kelp, Bamboo, and Sugar Cane

Overrides sapling recipes for:
*Vanilla trees
*Ars Nouveau

Adds soil support for the following mods:	
*Oh, the Biomes You'll Go - just Peat for now
*Farmer's Delight (Rich Soil)
	
All sapling recipes:
*Change sapling drop rate to 1%
*Change log drop rate to 100%
*Remove stick drops altogether - I'll craft sticks if I need them
*Remove fruit drops (apples, etc) altogether
*Change leaves drop rate to 25%
